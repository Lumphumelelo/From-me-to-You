			In the whispers of joy, where laughter spills like sunlight,
		<br>
			I care, a steady heartbeat that echoes your delight.
		<br>
			When happiness dances in your eyes, a sparkle that won't fade, 
		<br>
			I'm here, a constant presence, a love that's not afraid.
		</p>
		<p>
			In the depths of sorrow, where tears fall like autumn rain,
		<br>
			I care, a gentle touch that wipes away the pain.
		<br>
			When sadness wraps its heavy arms around your heart,
		<br>
			I'm here, a soothing balm that helps you heal from the start.
		</p>
		<p>
			In the quiet moments, when the world slows its frantic pace,
		<br>
			I care, a silent guardian that watches over your space.
		<br>
			When solitude wraps its comforting cloak around your soul,
		<br>
			I'm here, a gentle whisper that reminds you you're not alone.
		</p>
		<p>
			In the noise, the chaos, the cacophony of life's demands,
		<br>
			I care, a steady voice that cuts through the noise, that understands.
		<br>
			When the world outside is loud, and your heart feels overwhelmed,
		<br>
			I'm here, a calm refuge, a safe haven where you can be yourself.
		</p>
		<p>
			When no one else is looking, when the crowds disperse and fade,
		<br>
			I care, a constant love that remains, a flame that never fades.
		<br>
			When you're lost, and alone, and the darkness seems so vast,
		<br>
			I'm here, a guiding light that shines, a love that will forever last.
		</p>
		<p>
			When everyone around you rallies, and their voices rise,
		<br>
			I care, a love that's genuine, a heart that truly empathizes.
		<br>
			In the midst of celebration, when joy is contagious and free,
		<br>
			I'm here, a partner in your happiness, a love that's meant to be.
		</p>
		<p>
			In the everyday moments, the mundane, the ordinary too,
		<br>
			I care, a love that's woven into the fabric of our lives anew.
		<br>
			In the laughter, the tears, the triumphs, and the strife,
		<br>
			I'm here, a constant presence, a love that's your safe haven in life.
		</p>
		<p>
			So know that I care, in every moment, every breath,
		<br>
			A love that's unwavering, a heart that beats for you, in life, in death.
		<br>
			In the beauty and the ugliness, the joy and the pain,
		<br>
			I care, a love that's unconditional, a love that remains
